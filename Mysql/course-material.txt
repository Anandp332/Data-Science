Regarding reference material for the courses

I prepare lectures based on various papers, books and my own experience. You are expected to attend lectures, study the papers and form your own understanding. Most of the papers you are expected to study are mentioned below. 

You may find some books helpful in your endeavor to form your own understanding. But note well that there is NO single book to be used as the text-book for any of the courses I take.

Also you are advised to avoid locally authored/published books as they may contain material of questionable quality and may potentially be outright misleading.

You may be notified about the updates to the list of reference material as needed.
